## 🚀 Features

### 📱 APK Analysis
- Permission usage and risk scoring  
- Network security validation  
- Code-level pattern detection  
- Tracker and third-party library identification  
- AndroidManifest.xml security checks

### 📜 Privacy Policy Analysis
- Compliance verification of policy text  
- Correlation of requested permissions and declared policies  
- Automated reporting for compliance gaps  
- Suggestions for improving privacy policy language

### 🧠 Machine Learning Risk Assessment
- Predicts privacy risk scores using trained models  
- Identifies critical features affecting the risk score  
- Classifies apps by risk level with confidence metrics

### 🔐 Security Scoring
- Evaluates app components for known vulnerabilities  
- Flags insecure configurations  
- Provides actionable security recommendations  
- Validates manifest file setup

### 🔴 Real-time Monitoring *(Optional Module)*
- Detects privacy leaks during runtime  
- Triggers alerts for suspicious activity  
- Logs potentially risky behavior for audit
